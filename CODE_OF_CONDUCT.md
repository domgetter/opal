# Contributor Code of Conduct

1. We are all adults. Capable of having adult discussions.

2. We accept everyone's contributions; we do not care if you're liberal or conservative, black or white, straight or gay, or anything else! In fact, we won't bring it up, or ask. We simply do not care.

3. Nothing else matters!

This *not* Code of Conduct is adapted from the [NCoC - Not Code Of Conduct](http://nocodeofconduct.com/).
